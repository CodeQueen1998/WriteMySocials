    <strong>My Story:</strong><br><br>
    Welcome to my agency.<br>
    I'm Siyana Deveaux. I was a qualified English teacher in London<br>
    for a year, before I fell in love with marketing. London felt like the hub of digital marketing.<br>
    And with my background, in education. I felt like I could merge<br>
    two connecting worlds,<br>
    English Literature and Digital Marketing<br>
    = copywriting...<br><br>
    WriteMySocials was born.
